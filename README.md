# CSharp-Console-Tax-Calculator
First console CSharp app(with colors) takes a csv file with tax brackets for different states and calculates your taxes. Feel free to play around with it since I think it can be alot better than what it is. This is my first finished c# .Net Core console project and I'm pretty proud of it.

## How to use the calculator
The built in CSV file has buggy data allowing me to test for broken data, so you can use your own implementation of tax data for all states. makes sure it is in the same format as the current CSV file. Aditionnally you can add a Employees list with their states and income data, this console will provide you with their total taxes.

## Contribution Guidelines 
Any issues and pull requests will be appreciated for this app since it will help in my learning and increase the functionality of it.
